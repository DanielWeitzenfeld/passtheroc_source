      "In this post, I'm going to advocate for data scientists using an ORM like the one in SQLAlchemy.  But I should start with a disclaimer about my experience, because the case I'm going to make isn't going to be relevant to everyone.  My experience is at small startups, where I was responsible for working on a wide variety of tasks, and where I had to pull and clean data myself.  If you work at a larger company, with a team of data engineers whose job it is to provide you with clean datasets, this post will be less relevant.  Also, I came to data science from a background in statistics; if you have a compsci or a programming background, this may be old hat to you.\n",

Before I started using SQLAlchemy, there were three ways I may have approached this problem:\n",

If we end up using the feature a lot, I would recommend going with 3.  But if we aren't sure yet how much we'll use the feature, or if our data engineer is busy with more pressing problems, it would be nice to have another option.\n",
